# Study-Specific Quality, Utility, and Breadth Assessment

See below for a table of the currently available modules. Each module has a distinct repository within the Github organization which can be accessed via the link in the "Module" column. The packages also pull general use functions from the [squba.gen](https://github.com/ssdqa/squba.gen) repository where needed.

|   | Module | Description | Additional Metadata |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Cohort Fitness | [Patient Facts](https://github.com/ssdqa/patientfacts) | Assesses the availability of patient data per year of follow-up and visit type | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/32) |
|  | [Patient Record Consistency](https://github.com/ssdqa/patientrecordconsistency) | Tests whether the clinical data in a patient's record is consistent based on two clinical events (e.g., patients with leukemia should be receiving chemotherapy) | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/31) |
|  | [Patient Event Sequencing](https://github.com/ssdqa/patienteventsequencing) | Evaluates the plausibility of the temporal relationship between two clinical events (e.g., a diagnosis of chronic kidney disease should precede a dialysis procedure) | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/34) |
| Variable Testing | [Expected Variables Present](https://github.com/ssdqa/expectedvariablespresent) | Checks for the presence of and provides distributions of variables in a dataset | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/27) |
|  | [Quantitative Variable Distribution](https://github.com/ssdqa/quantvariabledistribution) | Assesses the distribution of quantitative variables, which can be numeric variables in the data (e.g., blood pressure values) and/or patient counts (e.g., patients with an inpatient visit) | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/21) |
| Concept-Set Testing | [Concept-Set Distribution](https://github.com/ssdqa/conceptsetdistribution) | Checks the distributions of concepts that form or represent a particular variable in a dataset | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/25) |
|  | [Source and Concept Vocabularies](https://github.com/ssdqa/sourceconceptvocabularies) | Evaluates source-to-concept and/or concept-to-source mappings and their distributions to explore how standardization may result in information loss | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/24) |
| Cohort Identification | [Attrition Step](https://github.com/ssdqa/cohortattrition) | Assesses each step of an attrition to identify patterns and anomalies in cohort construction | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/36) |
|  | [Sensitivity to Selection Criteria](https://github.com/ssdqa/sensitivityselectioncriteria) | Evaluate the differences in demographics, follow-up time, and utilization patterns when alternate cohort definitions are used | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/37){.uri} |
| Dataset Fitness | [Clinical Events and Specialty Agreement](https://github.com/ssdqa/clinicalevents.specialties) | Evaluate the concordance of specific events (e.g., diagnosis of type I diabetes) and specialist providers or care sites (e.g., endocrinologist or endocrinology clinic) at the visit level | [PEDSpace](https://pedsnet.org/metadata/handle/20.500.14642/28) |
